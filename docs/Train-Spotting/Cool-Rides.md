# Cool Rides

Here are some cool rides and heritage (or not) railways in and around the Brisbane area and maybe some other ones I've checked out in my admittedly rather limited travels.

## Mary Valley Rattler

The [Mary Valley Rattler](https://www.maryvalleyrattler.com.au/) offers a variety of heritage services starting at the [Old Gympie Railway Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mary+Valley+Rattler/@-26.1875834,152.6712482,19z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6b94a36e51c855a9:0xc9504afc474a59f3!8m2!3d-26.1875388!4d152.6715335!16s%2Fg%2F11hb3c9k1_!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Their prices range from $69 for a classic return run, to $495 for the "Footplate Friends Experience" of riding with the driver (18+ only)! and you get merch!!! I would really love to do that someday but Gympie is a long ways away and I'm broke so idk. You can also ride on the historic and really cool looking [2000 class rail motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Railways_2000_class_rail_motor) that used to operate around Brisbane in their "silver bullet" experience!

## The Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway

The [Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway](https://www.qpsr.org/) is a historic railway group club thing located near Ipswich. It runs through the former West Moreton pioneering coal fields and operates from [Swanbank Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/QPSR+Swanbank+Train+Station/@-27.6547954,152.8077046,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6b96b537721a09f7:0xddf802d150da67f3!8m2!3d-27.6538455!4d152.815216!16s%2Fg%2F11hctjngz2!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). As of Jan 17 2025, they offer two services: the Swanbank Collier and the Twilight Santa Train, both hauled by a diesel loco and taking about 90 and 75 minutes respectively. This is due to change, however, as they have not yet updated their bookings for 2025.

## Brisbane Bayside Steam Railway Society

The [Brisbane Bayside Steam Railway Society](https://www.brisbanebaysidesteamrailway.com.au/index.html) operate steam and diesel miniature train rides, on the first and third Sundays each month near [Wynnum](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brisbane+Bayside+Steam+Railway/@-27.4596745,153.1460421,17.46z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6b915ef9d4a7e4b7:0x48d9eaf2dd0e7443!8m2!3d-27.4607063!4d153.1477465!16s%2Fg%2F11b76r_17k!5m1!1e2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). It only costs $3 for a ticket, or $10 for five rides. A steal of a deal if you ask me (or should I say a _steam_ of a deal)?
