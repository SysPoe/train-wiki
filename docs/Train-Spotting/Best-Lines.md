## Gold Coast / Airport line

NGR's most of the day, with IMU's at peak times. You may get like 3 IMU's a day, so not exactly common and most probably no EMU's.

## Beenleigh / Ferny Grove

NGR's are prohibited on Ferny Grove line because Gathorne Station is so curved that the guard who has to positioned at the back on NGR's can't see all the way around the platform. Because Beenleigh is Ferny Grove's pair, it does not get NGR's either. Thus, mostly IMU's / SMU's will appear on the line, with EMU's sometiems on Ferny Grove.

## Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line:

NGR's are common on the Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line because of the large amount of stabling at Kippa Ring, as well as at Wulkuraka/Redbank. However, there are rarely EMU's on it when it's not an NGR.

## Rosewood

NGR's are not allowed west of Ipswich, so there is mostly IMU's, SMU's, and EMU's on the Rosewood line.

## Ipswich / Caboolture / Nambour
Mainly SMU's and IMU's but some NGR's.

## Gympie North

NGRs will not operate on Sunshine Coast line services north of Nambour until signalling upgrades to Gympie North have been completed. Currently trains are required to be compatible with the operation of Automatic Train Protection which isn't fitted on the NGRs. (Information may be outdated).

The Gympie North line generally features IMU100's/120's.

## Cleveland / Shorncliffe
The Cleveland / Shorncliffe line has the second least amount of NGR's on it, after Beenleigh / Ferny Grove, most likely due to stabling reasons. However, it is still mostly NGR's. 

## Post CRR

NGR, along with upgraded SMU 260 trains, will be the only trains permitted to travel in the Cross River Rail tunnels
