## Gold Coast / Airport line

NGRs most of the day, with IMUs at peak times. You may get like 3 IMUs a day, so not exactly common and most probably no EMUs.

## Beenleigh / Ferny Grove

NGRs are prohibited on Ferny Grove line because Gathorne Station is so curved that the guard who has to positioned at the back on NGRs can't see all the way around the platform. Because Beenleigh is Ferny Grove's pair, it does not get NGRs either. Thus, mostly IMUs / SMUs will appear on the line, with EMUs sometimes on Ferny Grove.

## Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line:

NGRs are common on the Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line because of the large amount of stabling at Kippa Ring, as well as at Wulkuraka/Redbank. However, there are rarely EMUs on it when it's not an NGR.

## Rosewood

NGRs are not allowed west of Ipswich, so there is mostly IMUs, SMUs, and EMUs on the Rosewood line.

## Ipswich / Caboolture / Nambour

Mainly SMUs and IMUs but some NGRs.

## Gympie North

NGRs will not operate on Sunshine Coast line services north of Nambour until signalling upgrades to Gympie North have been completed. Currently trains are required to be compatible with the operation of Automatic Train Protection which isn't fitted on the NGRs. (Information may be outdated).

The Gympie North line generally features IMU100's/120's due to the ATP requirement.

## Cleveland / Shorncliffe

The Cleveland / Shorncliffe line has the second least amount of NGRs on it, after Beenleigh / Ferny Grove, most likely due to stabling reasons. However, it is still mostly NGRs.

## Post CRR

NGR, along with upgraded SMU 260 trains, will be the only trains permitted to travel in the Cross River Rail tunnels
