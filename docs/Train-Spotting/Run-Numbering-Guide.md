## 3rd Character – Part of the train ID or additional information

Mainly part of the trains actual number but in many cases, the 3rd character is used to supply additional information on
the train. If the 3rd character is numeric, there is no additional information. 3rd character alpha codes are not found
in any manual or text book. They are usually locally agreed characters and can vary in different parts of the state.

Brisbane district:-

NOTE – ‘a’ = Alpha, ‘n’ = numeric, ‘x’ = alpha/numeric. All descriptions have examples, except “work trains”.
