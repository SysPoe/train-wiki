# AnyTrip

AnyTrip is an android app and website, that shows you the live location of all the trains, buses, trams, and ferries
on the TransLink network in SEQ, as well as other regions where available, like New Zealand and NSW.

It can also provide information on the bus and train, like run number, vehicle model, and other stats. However, it is
not perfect as it uses the run number to determine the vehicle model, only allowing it to accurately tell you if the
train is an NGR, or _could_ be an EMU. Most of the run numbers for the suburban network
start with either `1`, `D`, `T`, or `J`. As you can see at the [Train Numbering Guide](Train-Numbering-Guide.md), `1` and
`J` can be either an SMU or EMU, and SMU260s with IMU160s regularly use run numbers that start with `T` or `1`. The run
number can be used to divine more information, however. If the 2nd digit is a `6`, then it is an EMU running
Rosewood service.

The app does have a paid tier, promising ad-free operation and extra features including showing passing stops at a train, showing passing trains at a stop, and displaying the run number on the map, these do not actually work in QLD. It also promises more frequent updates and beta features, but last I can tell the app was updated in 2023. I still consider it worth the 8 AUD a year to help keep it up and running and get rid of the ads.
