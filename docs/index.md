# Hello!

Welcome to _SysPoe's Train Wiki!_
This site is dedicated to Queensland Rail's SEQ network and providing information for people who love trains (like me!) Other trains that I am interested in may appear here as well. And maybe buses too.

This website is still a bit of a work in progress, so you might find some pages with notes or other things that I want to remember to add later, but aren't fully fleshed out. Some other pages might link to external websites which contain similar information until I decide to transfer it over and add my own stuff.

Have fun!

By the way, if you would like the original uncompressed versions of the images in the gallery, and maybe some other train photos please feel free to [email me](mailto:poe@duck.com). Please also email me if you find any issues with the site, would like me to add more information about a certain topic, or you have your own photos that you would like to add (with full credit given).

You can also see the source code of this wiki over at [https://github.com/SysPoe/train-wiki](https://github.com/SysPoe/train-wiki). It might not last there forever, though, and I might have to migrate the media to another site that allows for larger files. So far, almost all of the media and archives are stored in the repo. As of Feb 10, 2025, it totals a whopping 3.05GB.
