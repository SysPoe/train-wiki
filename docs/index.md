# Hello!

Welcome to _SysPoe's Train Wiki!_
This site is dedicated to Queensland Rail's SEQ network and providing information for people who love trains (like me!) Other trains that I am interested in may appear here as well. And maybe buses too.

Have fun!

By the way, if you would like the original uncompressed versions of the images in the gallery, and maybe some other train photos please feel free to [email me](mailto:poe@duck.com). Please also email me if you find any issues with the site, would like me to add more information about a certain topic, or you have your own photos that you would like to add (with full credit given).
