# NGR (New Generation Rollingstock)

As far as I know the only line they can't do is Ferny Grove. It has to do with the curve at Gaythorne. The Guard's view
of the platform is obstructed from their cabin at the rear of the NGR set. I didn't know why they just can't set up a
mirror or a monitor showing a live feed from a camera further up the platform.
