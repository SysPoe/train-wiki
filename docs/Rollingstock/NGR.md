# NGR (New Generation Rollingstock)


## Some Observations about NGR's
### Uncomfortable Seats

> That's right, the high back was a new feature as part of the design. The foam used in the seat was required to meet new (compared to the 160/260) EN fire standards which meant that to attain the fire performance the foam has graphite in it to improve its fire performance.
> 
> The 160/260 is going through overhaul but the fire standard for overhaul allows you to replace components with materials "no worse than" the original from a fire performance perspective.
> 
> The new trains (QTMP) have a requirement for higher comfort levels and with new foam technologies they should be compliant to the code and much more comfortable.

### Lack of NGR's on Ferny Grove / Beenleigh line

> So as far as I understand (and QR employees can correct me here) and as far as most people on transport forums understand the red line can’t run NGR’s because gaythorne station is so curved that the guard who has to positioned at the back on NGR’s can’t see all the way around the platform, since EMU’s SMU’s and IMU’s are 2 sets of 3 carriages the guard stands in the middle so can see both sides
> 
> Now the QTMP’s are also supposed to be sets of 6 rather than sets of 3 so they will also have the same problems, alongside this the QTMP’s will decommission the EMU’s so there will be even fewer trains that can run on the red line and they will continue to get older and older.

> NGR's are coming to Ferny Grove, I’m not privy to the exact date but they just added a raised section to Keperra and extended the end of the platforms. Its only a matter of time. Theres other stations that have a curve like Gaythorne and the cameras on the NGR work fine. i.e. Morningside outbound, guard cant see the front of the platform

### NGR's are not permitted west of Ipswich

### Loud Brakes
> apparently it's shit brake pad material and because of it, brake calipers having to clamp down so hard in order to brake. I wouldn't be surprised that's another thing they'll have to fix on top of putting in a new toilet at Maryborough to comply with DDA
