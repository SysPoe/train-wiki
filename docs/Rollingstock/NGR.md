# NGR (New Generation Rollingstock)

So as far as I understand (and QR employees can correct me here) and as far as most people on transport forums understand the red line can’t run NGR’s because gaythorne station is so curved that the guard who has to positioned at the back on NGR’s can’t see all the way around the platform, since EMU’s SMU’s and IMU’s are 2 sets of 3 carriages the guard stands in the middle so can see both sides

Now the QTMP’s are also supposed to be sets of 6 rather than sets of 3 so they will also have the same problems, alongside this the QTMP’s will decommission the EMU’s so there will be even fewer trains that can run on the red line and they will continue to get older and older.

NGRs are coming to Ferny Grove, I’m not privy to the exact date but they just added a raised section to Keperra and extended the end of the platforms. Its only a matter of time. Theres other stations that have a curve like Gaythorne and the cameras on the NGR work fine. i.e. Morningside outbound, guard cant see the front of the platform
