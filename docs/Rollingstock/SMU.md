To keep the auxiliary converters (and systems) online through neutral sections 220’s and 120’s automatically apply a small amount of regenerative braking when traversing neutral sections at speeds above 20km/h. This reduces the need to rely on the battery system and is why they maintain full lighting and air conditioning compared to other units in the fleet.

For some reason at speeds around 40-60km/h they can produce a rather nasty shudder through the train. As a driver there isn’t much that can be done to prevent it. Some do it, some don’t, some are worse than others. Just a quirk of the units.
