# QTMP / NNGR (Queensland Train Manufacturing Program / New NGR)

**This page is under construction!! Check out [QTMP on TMR's Website](https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/projects/programs/queensland-train-manufacturing-program).**

The QTMP is a $9.5 billion program funded by the Queensland Government to design, build, and maintain 65 new trains for the SEQ network. The program also includes the construction of a purpose-built manufacturing faciltiy in the Fraser Coast region, as well as a new rail faciltiy in Ormeau for train maintenance and stabling.

> QTMP contract has an option for a further 10 but they cant guarantee they will be delivered before the Olympics, only the 65 already contracted.

QTMP trains will be "the most accessible trains in Australia", with leading technology including train boarding bridges and electronic levelling control to address the horizontal and vertical gaps between platforms and trains. This will allow people using mobility devices and wheelchairs the option to board independently at any door without assistance and use one of the 20 wheelchair allocated spaces located throughout the train<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
