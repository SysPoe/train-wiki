This is just a list of stuff I want to add to this website or change about it or stuff.

# Trainspotting

Yeerongpilly overpass

Moorooka, Rocklea and Salisbury Stations
Acacia Ridge (on the road bridge)

Roma Street – both above the busway and in the station itself. You can also get a great view from within the Roma Street Parklands.

Wooloowin Station

Virginia Station – Take the bike path between Brickyard Road Dog Park and Norths Junior Rugby League to see trains pass just meters above your head! The rail overpass is so close you could almost reach up and touch it.

Dakabin Station

Morayfield Station

Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood and Corinda Stations

Wacol, Ebbw Vale, Wulkuraka, Karrabin, Walloon, Thagoona Stations

Pedestrian bridge at Strathpine Station
