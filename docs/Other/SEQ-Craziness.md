# SEQ Train Craziness

There have certainly been a variety of track closures and other things that have forced trains to take new routes to get through. One of the most common is a Cleveland / Ferny Grove line pairing due to Northern track closures, as those two lines are the only ones fully running. Here are some more ones I found, and you can view some others observed before my time by another train fan - [Rail Town Productions](https://www.youtube.com/@RailTownProductions) - here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsP7z1D3Htz0ZEf6jGmSVCP-idQHz5_9t](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsP7z1D3Htz0ZEf6jGmSVCP-idQHz5_9t)

## Doomben train at Milton

This occured during New Year's Eve 2024, just after the 7:45pm fireworks, so they were running more frequent services and all of the fares were free, but I'm still not sure why they would do this.
