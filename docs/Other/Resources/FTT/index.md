# Freight Train Timetables

This is just annotated versions of the Master Train Plans, which show freight train movements, to include the current time of day (the verical grey bar on the graph), as well as allow you to easily switch between days. I might end up making a mega wide version that has the whole week in one.

I think the 4-digit code might be the run number, and I think that it are repeated every week. Not sure why it says the date. Maybe cuz the QR team print it out, so whenever they print out the next one they just change the date to be the one they need.

For the run numbers, you might want to use [QRIG's run numbering guide](https://qrig.org/safeworking/train-numbering-guide) instead cuz it has all of the ones instead of just the suburban ones. You can also check out my [Run Guru](../RunGuru/index.md).

Anyway, here are the current ones I've done:

Remember to zoom in and pan around :)
