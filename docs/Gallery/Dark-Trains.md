# Dark Trains

Trains can lose power for various reasons, and with the UV strip lighting on the NGRs it makes for some pretty cool photos, and pretty creepy photos on the older generation trains. Here are some photos I found of dark trains, along with their associated stories, for your viewing pleasure.

## 1: Caboolture / Nambour NGR power outages

> Was on the Caboolture/Nambour Train last night, thought we had missed the storms.
>
> We lost mains power between Elimbah & Beerburrum. Coasted for awhile, ended up stopping maybe… 900m from Beerburrum station - a super terrible spot for mobile phone coverage.
>
> Announcement came on that we had lost it, investigating. About 10 minutes later that the time to inspection was at least 55 minutes, which exceeds the Trains battery.
>
> So we got to be in the dark, with no AC. People handled it pretty well. I’ve never done a train evacuation before.
>
> After we all bailed out, we trundled up the tracks to Beerburrum Station.
