The TLS Deed provides for a collaborative approach to the delivery of the TLS activities where staff from Hitachi will work in parallel with Queensland Rail staff to undertake the maintenance activities within the TLS Deed whilst upskilling Queensland Rail staff.",Not applicable,"During the TLS support period the integrated systems will be primarily be maintained by QR’s LoR1 and LoR2 teams, and supported by STS LoR1 and LoR2 resources as required, to provide the necessary safety assurances of the ETCS System. The objectives of the TLS are to:
1. Ensuring Safety Integrity of QR’s Rail Network
2. Minimising Impacts to Operations that could affect production
3. Supporting the availability of the ETCS L2 system in operation
4. Supporting the transition of QR staff maintaining the ETCS L2 system autonomously
As the field systems are to be delivered in phases and with fit out progressing prior to the completion of all system deliveries, additional considerations are needed to comply with the points above.
Specifically, both the inclusion of regular Periodic Preventative Maintenance procedures to satisfy Safety, as well as Preventative and Corrective Maintenance procedures to minimise production impacts and support the operational phased deployment of the ETCS L2 system, are required.
For Preventative Maintenance, the Section 8 Indicative Preventative Maintenance Tasks Lists are intended to provide the necessary coverage to maintain the integrity of the system operation.
For Corrective Maintenance these shall be prioritised based on operational impact identified at the time of the fault. These faults will be tracked using QR’s Enterprise Asset Management System (EAMS).
A spare parts analysis will be conducted following the Project RAM Analysis to support the spares requirements for the TLS period.",CW2291282,,,,,
