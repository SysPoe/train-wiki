<p>Apparently the pantographs last half as long as the other trains, and they have more flange squeal.</p>
<p>The NGR trains were designed and built so that ETCS equipment could be retrofitted once an ETCS solution for the SEQ rail network was identified. Project works (New Generation Rollingstock, European Train Control System fitment, install new signalling) will include the design and fitment of rollingstock-based equipment for ETCS, automatic train operations and platform screen doors<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

<p>The foam used in the NGRs' seats were required to meet the new (compared to the 160/260) EN fire standards in order to go through the CRR tunnels, which meant that in order to attain the fire performance required, the foam has graphite in it. While the 160/260 is going through overhaul, the fire standard for overhaul allows you to replace components with materials "no worse than" the original from a fire performance perspective.</p>
<p>The QTMP will have a higher requirement for comfort levels, and with new foam technologies they should be compliant to the code while still being comfortable.</p>

<p>The NGR trains are not able to run on the Ferny Grove line at all, as they leave a large gap between the train and platform at some stations, meaning passengers cannot board safely and, at Newmarket and Keperra, the platforms are too short to accommodate the NGR trains at all. Due to these issues—and the pairing of the Ferny Grove and Beenleigh lines—it means the NGR trains also do not run on the Beenleigh line as part of the regular timetable<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

<p>On the Rosewood line, the NGR trains are too long for the platform, forcing passengers into the front three cars, otherwise they would step and fall onto the tracks<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>

<p>So the button announcement was brought in when the new trains were commenced ~10 years ago. The first week on the new trains, there was a lot of confusion because the buttons used to be on the left and right of the doors.</p>
<p>I remember being stuck on a train about to leave central with a dozen people at peak hour staring bewilderedly at the walls around us trying to figure out how to open the doors, until some champion took pity on us, barged through and pressed the button in the middle.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the button announcements began.</p>

<p>At approximately 4:20pm, an NGR train (that had not yet completed testing or been accepting by the government) and shunting tractor derailed near Wulkuraka maintenance centre<sup>[3]</sup>. The wheels of at least one of the carriages jumped the rails, leaving the train stranded<sup>[4]</sup>. At the time of the incident, the NGR train was being towed by the shunting tractor on the access line at the eastern end of the Wulkuraka maintenance centre. This access line is used exclusively by Bombardier to facilitate NGR train movements in, out and around Wulkuraka separately from the main Queensland Rail network. The two Bombardier staff involved in the incident were not injured<sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
