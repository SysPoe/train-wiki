Here are some photos I found of dark trains, along with their associated stories, for your viewing pleasure. 1: Caboolture / Nambour NGR power outages \u00b6 u/not_a_medical_doctor on Reddit : Was on the Caboolture/Nambour Train last night, thought we had missed the storms. We lost mains power between Elimbah & Beerburrum. Coasted for awhile, ended up stopping maybe\u2026 900m from Beerburrum station - a super terrible spot for mobile phone coverage. Announcement came on that we had lost it, investigating. About 10 minutes later that the time to inspection was at least 55 minutes, which exceeds the Trains battery. So we got to be in the dark, with no AC. People handled it pretty well. I\u2019ve never done a train evacuation before. After we all bailed out, we trundled up the tracks to Beerburrum Station. 2: SMU260 @ Midnight \u00b6 u/akkobutnotreally on Reddit : Alright, I got everyone hooked with the photo. Now you'll have to read the story behind it. It was late. I was at Robina waiting for something to get me to Helensvale. My girlfriend was waiting for me there. The train arrives on time at 11:42pm: a pair of SMU260s. \"Weird\", I thought: the Gold Coast line is mostly served by NGRs but it didn't matter at that point. We departed on time as well. The lights on the last carriage were already turned off. I asked the guard about it and he told me that they were planning to uncouple the rear unit at Beenleigh. He was just making preparations beforehand, and then he asked me where I was headed to. \"Helensvale\", I said. He said I could stay in the dark carriage for the moment if I wanted to, so I went and picked a front-facing seat. It was pitch black. Mostly silent: just the sound of the motors going at speed. I've always liked trains, but back in my home country it's always a shitshow to be on one. Between the morons playing music with pretty much an entire band, fuckwits selling you shit or idiots asking you for money, as well as the employees just not giving a fuck and taking bribes to look the other way. It's never a pleasant experience. It's futile for me. I started to cry. I've been living here for just a few months and I just couldn't believe it. I feel safe here. I can enjoy my time on the rails here, just zoning out and actually smiling for once, or sometimes exchanging a quick chat with the QR employees which always seem to be kind enough to talk with this idiot. We arrived at Helensvale. I said thanks to the guard and went to my girlfriend's car. Thanks to everyone for being so friendly. It means a lot to me. 3: NGR Restart \u00b6 https://imgur.com/3oQMwy3 , u/beastjim on Reddit : An NGR that stopped at Bowen Hills and had to do a full restart to fix something, taken around midnight.","title":"Dark Trains"},{"location":"Gallery/Dark-Trains/#dark-trains","text":"Trains can lose power for various reasons, and with the UV strip lighting on the NGRs it makes for some pretty cool photos, and pretty creepy photos on the older generation trains.

Now you'll have to read the story behind it. It was late. I was at Robina waiting for something to get me to Helensvale. My girlfriend was waiting for me there. The train arrives on time at 11:42pm: a pair of SMU260s. \"Weird\", I thought: the Gold Coast line is mostly served by NGRs but it didn't matter at that point. We departed on time as well. The lights on the last carriage were already turned off. I asked the guard about it and he told me that they were planning to uncouple the rear unit at Beenleigh. He was just making preparations beforehand, and then he asked me where I was headed to. \"Helensvale\", I said. He said I could stay in the dark carriage for the moment if I wanted to, so I went and picked a front-facing seat. It was pitch black. Mostly silent: just the sound of the motors going at speed. I've always liked trains, but back in my home country it's always a shitshow to be on one. Between the morons playing music with pretty much an entire band, fuckwits selling you shit or idiots asking you for money, as well as the employees just not giving a fuck and taking bribes to look the other way. It's never a pleasant experience. It's futile for me. I started to cry. I've been living here for just a few months and I just couldn't believe it. I feel safe here. I can enjoy my time on the rails here, just zoning out and actually smiling for once, or sometimes exchanging a quick chat with the QR employees which always seem to be kind enough to talk with this idiot. We arrived at Helensvale. I said thanks to the guard and went to my girlfriend's car. Thanks to everyone for being so friendly. It means a lot to me.","title":"2: SMU260 @ Midnight"},{"location":"Gallery/Dark-Trains/#3-ngr-restart","text":"https://imgur.com/3oQMwy3 , u/beastjim on Reddit : An NGR that stopped at Bowen Hills and had to do a full restart to fix something, taken around midnight.","title":"3: NGR Restart"},{"location":"Gallery/Photos/","text":"Train Photos \u00b6 Here is a selection of some of my train photos that I think are nice, in no particular order (apart from the categories).

Back in the 1970s, QR stared electrifying Brisbane's suburban railways. The first section completed was between Ferny Grove and Darra and naturally, QR needed some new electric trains to run along the electrified route. QR ordered a batch of modern air-conditioned commuter trains from Walkers/ASEA at Maryborough. The EMUs are composed of three cars permanently coupled and are capable of seating up to 248 passengers, however they are often operated with two sets coupled together to form a six-car set. The 88 suburban units weigh approx. 150 tonnes, are 72.4m over couplers, have a maximum service speed of 100km/h (62.5mph) and an emergency stopping distance from that speed of only 415 metres. Individual car seating capacity: 80 (DM101\u201388: driving motor car, DT301\u201359, DT380\u20138: driving trailer car, T460\u201379: trailer car) 88 (M201\u201388: motor car) Sets 01\u201313 have a smooth roof, while Sets 14\u201388, which were built from 1983 to 1986, have a corrugated roof. Most sets consist of a driving motor car, motor car and a driving trailer car. Sets 60\u201379 consist of a driving motor car, motor car and a trailer car, and thus have a driver\u2019s cab at only one end, so operate with two sets combined to form a six-carriage train. All cars are air-conditioned with air operated doors, which can be opened by passengers and are closed by drivers. A public address system, UHF crew to crew radio and crew intercommunication systems are fitted. Guards sometimes make passenger announcements when the automatic announcements aren\u2019t working. They were paired with SMU200s 'early on', but after a derailment between Central and Roma Street (leaving the old tunnels towards Platform 7) they put a stop to it [8] . For some reason, the emergency brake actually takes longer to stop than the full service brake (maybe due to wheel slippage?), but QR crews are required to press the emergency brake in an emergency. Bit of an oversight there. Like all other passenger trains operating within the Brisbane Suburban Area, EMUs are fitted with AWS (Audible Warning System). When there is an upcoming restrictive signal (any signal other than green), the driver must acknowledge the warning provided for it within three seconds of its receipt by pressing a button on trains' control panels. If the approaching signal is green, no acknowledgment by the driver is required. Should a train proceed past a restrictive signal without the driver having first acknowledged the warning, the train\u2019s emergency brakes are automatically applied to stop the train. For AWS to operate, both track and rollingstock must be equipped [9] . EMUs are also fitted with door sensors and traction interlocks. The sensors trigger the doors to open if they detect an obstruction upon closing, much like an elevator door. Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed. EMUs did not have these upon fabrication, however they were all retrofitted with them as part of a refurbishment program by September 2000 at a cost of $35,000 per 3-car (not inflation adjusted; ~$70,000 in 2025) [9] . Unlike other units, EMUs do not have rigid steel skirts to protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment [9] . Timeline \u00b6 July 1979 - December 1986 : EMU units delivered. 1984 : 48 units, which were purchased for the price of $44.26 million were sold and leased back. September 1986 : Units 84, 85, 86 and 88 were hauled to Gladstone to operate a VIP train to Rockhampton in connection with the completion of an electrification project, before operating some special services to Bajool and Mount Larcom. 29 April 1988 : Units 81\u201388 operated Sunshine Coast line services from Caboolture to Nambour pending the delivery of the InterCity Express fleet after being fitted with VHF radios. Others appeared on Sunshine Coast services with hand held radios. September 1988 : InterCity Express units delivered, EMUs operated in multiple with them for a period. August 1990 : Units 84 and 68 ran through to Gympie North temporarily. Late 1993 : EMUs fitted with yellow cab ends for higher visibility. 1996 : Some EMUs appeared on Gold Coast line services, although they were only used sparingly, not being geared to operate at the 140km/h line speed. 25 March 1996 : A Citytrain EMU collided with a freight train on 25 March 1996 at Bowen Hills. A subsequent board of inquiry into the collision found that it was caused by driver error. The driver of the passenger train failed to stop at a red signal, and the passenger train collided with the freight train as it crossed the track beyond the signal. The collision injured eight passengers and one employee, and caused extensive damage to both trains. The direct cost of the collision was estimated to be $2.72 million (not inflation adjusted; ~$5.66 million in 2024) [9] . 1998-2000 : The cab windows were modified on EMU60-88 for better visibility and also the fitting of a rear view mirror and security cameras inside. 2000 : The first series EMUs (01-19) were upgraded with high visibility cab ends which incorporated a fender (which incorporates an anti-climber to prevent outriders hanging off the back of a unit) with ditch lights and a new color scheme with a black band across the windscreen (hence the nickname of these units, \u2018Bandicoots\u2019). May 2001 : EMU62 was severely damaged after an Arson attack at Mayne. 21 September 2001 : EMU05 and EMU60 were both written off in the Cattletrain derailment at Petrie in September. EMU62 was returned to service, while one 3-car unit was salvaged out of both EMU05 and EMU60 to form EMU60, including EM305 (replacing EM160), EM260, and EM360. 2018 : Withdrawls begin of the EMUs as NGRs were delivered. January 2019 : 30 EMUs in store. August 2019 : Queensland Rail operated a farewell tour with units 01 and 04 over two days covering all Brisbane suburban lines including a reenactment of the first electric train service in Brisbane from Ferny Grove to Darra. Both units were removed from service and taken to Ipswich Workshops for static preservation. 2020 : EMU60 scrapped. 2023 : QR replaced the routers in EMUs, IMU100s, SMU200s, IMU120s, and SMU220s. The work was contracted out to Nomad Digital and cost $1.75 million [5] . QR also contracted UGL Rail to do a wheelset overhaul on one or (probably) multiple EMU trains, costing $700 thousand [5] . 2024, March 22 : QR launches an investigation following the detection of asbestos in an EMU. It was found in black bitumen paint on the floor and ceiling during asbestos clearing certification as part of the EMU disposal program. EMUs were deemed still safe to travel on, as the paint was sealed in areas that are not accessible to the public, however they were still progressively taken out of service for inspections [10] . 2024, March 27 : An independent asbestos assessor inspected the EMUs and deemed them safe to return to service. The asbestos was found to be in a sealed part of the train, and therefore when the shell of the EMU is covered there is negligible risk of exposure to asbestos [11] . 2024 : QR performed a variety of operations on one or multiple EMU trains (I'm guessing multiple because surely it can't cost that much to do it on just one), including: An overhaul of the transformers and reactors, contracted to AC Hargreaves and costing $1.32 million [5] . An overhaul of the AC units done by Noske-Kaeser Rail & Vehicle and costing $1.19 million [5] . Changed out some side doors on EMU trains, contracted to Festo for $422 thousand [5] . Changed out some couplers, contracted to Voith Turbo for $2.94 million [5] . \"Bogie relife\", and \"Bogie Relife 1\" (Heavy Overhaul of QR EMU Bogie) both contracted to Downer EDI Rail and totalling $12.63 million [5, 6] . 2025 : EMUs anticipated to commence retirement (as of August 2021) [7] . 2025, 5 July : EMU farewell tour, marking the last EMU service, operated by EMU59, the last remaining main-line worthy EMU train. EMU59 ran on the Ipswich, Caboolture, Ferny Grove, and Shorncliffe lines [12] .

Back in the 1970s, QR stared electrifying Brisbane's suburban railways. The first section completed was between Ferny Grove and Darra and naturally, QR needed some new electric trains to run along the electrified route. QR ordered a batch of modern air-conditioned commuter trains from Walkers/ASEA at Maryborough. The EMUs are composed of three cars permanently coupled and are capable of seating up to 248 passengers, however they are often operated with two sets coupled together to form a six-car set. The 88 suburban units weigh approx. 150 tonnes, are 72.4m over couplers, have a maximum service speed of 100km/h (62.5mph) and an emergency stopping distance from that speed of only 415 metres. Individual car seating capacity: 80 (DM101\u201388: driving motor car, DT301\u201359, DT380\u20138: driving trailer car, T460\u201379: trailer car) 88 (M201\u201388: motor car) Sets 01\u201313 have a smooth roof, while Sets 14\u201388, which were built from 1983 to 1986, have a corrugated roof. Most sets consist of a driving motor car, motor car and a driving trailer car. Sets 60\u201379 consist of a driving motor car, motor car and a trailer car, and thus have a driver\u2019s cab at only one end, so operate with two sets combined to form a six-carriage train. All cars are air-conditioned with air operated doors, which can be opened by passengers and are closed by drivers. A public address system, UHF crew to crew radio and crew intercommunication systems are fitted. Guards sometimes make passenger announcements when the automatic announcements aren\u2019t working. They were paired with SMU200s 'early on', but after a derailment between Central and Roma Street (leaving the old tunnels towards Platform 7) they put a stop to it [8] . For some reason, the emergency brake actually takes longer to stop than the full service brake (maybe due to wheel slippage?), but QR crews are required to press the emergency brake in an emergency. Bit of an oversight there. Like all other passenger trains operating within the Brisbane Suburban Area, EMUs are fitted with AWS (Audible Warning System). When there is an upcoming restrictive signal (any signal other than green), the driver must acknowledge the warning provided for it within three seconds of its receipt by pressing a button on trains' control panels. If the approaching signal is green, no acknowledgment by the driver is required. Should a train proceed past a restrictive signal without the driver having first acknowledged the warning, the train\u2019s emergency brakes are automatically applied to stop the train. For AWS to operate, both track and rollingstock must be equipped [9] . EMUs are also fitted with door sensors and traction interlocks. The sensors trigger the doors to open if they detect an obstruction upon closing, much like an elevator door. Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed. EMUs did not have these upon fabrication, however they were all retrofitted with them as part of a refurbishment program by September 2000 at a cost of $35,000 per 3-car (not inflation adjusted; ~$70,000 in 2025) [9] . Unlike other units, EMUs do not have rigid steel skirts to protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment [9] .","title":"EMU (Walkers/Adtranz Electric Multiple Unit)"},{"location":"Rollingstock/EMU/#timeline","text":"July 1979 - December 1986 : EMU units delivered. 1984 : 48 units, which were purchased for the price of $44.26 million were sold and leased back.

When they were first introduced, they cut the journey time by five hours [1] . As of November 2021, all units have been retired from service [2] . In 1987, in order to operate the Spirit of Capricorn line between Brisbane and Rockhampton, QR ordered 16 electric multiple carriages from Walkers, with the stainless steel design based on the EMUs operating suburban services at the time [1,2] . They were to be eight semi-permanently coupled pairs of a driving motor car (EMD) and a non-driving motor car (EMM) that were planned to operate as four-carriage sets [2] . ABB supplied the electrical equipment and the company's local partner, Walkers, manufactured the mechanical parts, partly to ABB's design [1] . In 1988 an additional four trailer cars (EMT) were ordered to allow the sets to be built up to five or six carriages [2] . The trains can be run in 4 or 6 car configuration, with two power pairs accompanied by either one or two trailer cars. A power pair consists of two power cars with ABB thyristor drive equipment, one of which has the driver's cab. They also used to multiple to EMUs forming a Hybrid unit (ICE Power pair + 3 car EMU), and would usually only do this for Gympie North services [1] . In November 1990 an eight car set was operated [2] . The first trials were conducted in May 1988, before the first entered service on Sunshine Coast line services from Brisbane to Nambour, operating in multiple with Electric Multiple Units. On 5 February 1989, they began to operate through to Gympie North. On 3 July 1989, they began to operate Spirit of Capricorn services to Rockhampton [2] . They were displaced from their intended use by the faster Electric Tilt Train in 1998, and the ICE was surplus to the requirements on the Central Queensland services. The Spirit of Capricorn service was ran for the last time on the 24 th of May 2003. After that they could be found doing Caboolture-Nambour shuttles, as well as Cooroy and Gympie North services [1] . They briefly operated on the Gold Coast line following its extension to Nerang in May 1998 and Robina in November 1998, and were also used on the Corinda-Yeerongpilly line from January 2000 after the withdrawal of the Queensland Railways 2000 class rail motor [2] . In 2001, all were fitted with power operated equipment to close the doors [2] . During 2003 and 2004, the ICE units were refurbished to upgrade the units to the current standards, including visibility lights, yellow saloon doors, upgraded toilets, and doors. The refurbishment program was undertaken by Walkers/EDI at Maryborough, where they were manufactured [1] . In 2005, the ICE power pairs again headed to Maryborough to receive angled window frames to replace the curved side windows [1] . ICE152 heading to Brisbane. By Jacob Macklin.

Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed [3] . SMUs, IMUs and ICEs were supplied with rigid steel skirts that protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment.

In 1987, in order to operate the Spirit of Capricorn line between Brisbane and Rockhampton, QR ordered 16 electric multiple carriages from Walkers, with the stainless steel design based on the EMUs operating suburban services at the time [1,2] . They were to be eight semi-permanently coupled pairs of a driving motor car (EMD) and a non-driving motor car (EMM) that were planned to operate as four-carriage sets [2] . ABB supplied the electrical equipment and the company's local partner, Walkers, manufactured the mechanical parts, partly to ABB's design [1] . In 1988 an additional four trailer cars (EMT) were ordered to allow the sets to be built up to five or six carriages [2] . The trains can be run in 4 or 6 car configuration, with two power pairs accompanied by either one or two trailer cars. A power pair consists of two power cars with ABB thyristor drive equipment, one of which has the driver's cab. They also used to multiple to EMUs forming a Hybrid unit (ICE Power pair + 3 car EMU), and would usually only do this for Gympie North services [1] . In November 1990 an eight car set was operated [2] . The first trials were conducted in May 1988, before the first entered service on Sunshine Coast line services from Brisbane to Nambour, operating in multiple with Electric Multiple Units. On 5 February 1989, they began to operate through to Gympie North. On 3 July 1989, they began to operate Spirit of Capricorn services to Rockhampton [2] . They were displaced from their intended use by the faster Electric Tilt Train in 1998, and the ICE was surplus to the requirements on the Central Queensland services. The Spirit of Capricorn service was ran for the last time on the 24 th of May 2003. After that they could be found doing Caboolture-Nambour shuttles, as well as Cooroy and Gympie North services [1] . They briefly operated on the Gold Coast line following its extension to Nerang in May 1998 and Robina in November 1998, and were also used on the Corinda-Yeerongpilly line from January 2000 after the withdrawal of the Queensland Railways 2000 class rail motor [2] . In 2001, all were fitted with power operated equipment to close the doors [2] . During 2003 and 2004, the ICE units were refurbished to upgrade the units to the current standards, including visibility lights, yellow saloon doors, upgraded toilets, and doors. The refurbishment program was undertaken by Walkers/EDI at Maryborough, where they were manufactured [1] . In 2005, the ICE power pairs again headed to Maryborough to receive angled window frames to replace the curved side windows [1] . ICE152 heading to Brisbane. By Jacob Macklin.

Like all other passenger trains operating within the Brisbane Suburban Area, ICEs are fitted with AWS (Audible Warning System). When there is an upcoming restrictive signal (any signal other than green), the driver must acknowledge the warning provided for it within three seconds of its receipt by pressing a button on trains' control panels. If the approaching signal is green, no acknowledgment by the driver is required. Should a train proceed past a restrictive signal without the driver having first acknowledged the warning, the train\u2019s emergency brakes are automatically applied to stop the train. For AWS to operate, both track and rollingstock must be equipped [3] . SMUs, along with IMUs, EMUs, and probably NGRs, are also fitted with door sensors and traction interlocks. The sensors trigger the doors to open if they detect an obstruction upon closing, much like an elevator door. Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed [3] . SMUs, IMUs and ICEs were supplied with rigid steel skirts that protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment. These skirts extend to within approximately 50 mm of the rails, and provide a measure of protection from damage caused by collisions with obstructions at track level [3] .","title":"ICE (Walkers/Adtranz InterCity Express)"},{"location":"Rollingstock/ICE/#technical-details","text":"Name Value Unit Numbers [1] EMD 5151-5158 EMM 6151-6159 EMT 7151-7154 Introduced [1] 1988 Builder [1] Walkers Ltd.

EDI/Bombardier Interurban Multiple Unit 100 series (IMU100) \u00b6 The IMU100 as seen on QR's Carriage Layouts page Timeline \u00b6 1993 : A contract for four IMU100 units was awarded to Walkers Limited, Maryborough [2] . July 1995 : As only four IMU100s were never adequate to service the line, a further six were ordered, numbered IMU105-110 [2] . 1996 : The first four IMU100s, IMU101-104, entered service before the opening of the new line [2] . 1997 : IMU105-110 delivered [2] . March - November 2001 : IMU100s upgraded to meet the new Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport requirements based on the IMU120 design. This upgrade included, but was not limited to, the addition of six allocated spaces in the saloon of the DT Car because this car housed the wheelchair accessible toilet and it was not feasible for passengers to be expected to move from one end of the unit to the other. This was due to the aisle width between the transverse seats being of insufficient width to provide an effective accessible pathway [9] . 2017 : IMU100s and SMU200s underwent an overhaul, including an upgrade of the traction package and Train Control Managment System on 10 IMU100s and 12 SMU200s, and one of the pneumatic cab doors of an IMU100 got upgraded. This work was done by Downer EDI Rail for $105,430,828 [13] . December 2018 : Downer secured a $80 million contract to refurbish the IMU100s along with the SMU200s at their Maryborough Service Delivery Centre. The upgrades included [8] : An interior refresh \u2013 new floor coverings, refreshed handrails and grab handles and new seat foams and covers for enhanced customer experience. An overhaul of key train subsystems to ensure the safety and reliability of the fleet. New electrical systems (in partnership with ABB), including upgrade of onboard traction equipment and installation of a new Train Control Management System (TCMS). January 17, 2020 : QR paid out $2.6 million to CoachAir for \"2019 IMU100 SMU200 HVAC Overhaul\" , possibly as part of Downer's refurbishment that started Dec 2018 [12] . 2023 : QR replaced the routers in EMUs, IMU100s, SMU200s, IMU120s, and SMU220s. The work was contracted out to Nomad Digital and cost $1.75 million [12] . 2023 : Refurbishment of IMU100s and SMU200s was completed including the interiors, with the sole exception of IMU105, which still retains it's green ocean themed seat covers [8] . 2038 : IMU100s anticipated to commence retirement (as of August 2021) [21] .

They entered service in 2001 and feature high-backed seats with a head cushion as an extension to the SMU220-based seat design [2] , as well as a top speed of 140km/h [14] . There is one toilet per unit and the luggage racks are in different configurations than the IMU100s due to interior design differences [2] . While the IMU100s and IMU120s can be used together to form 6-car sets, they no longer do so in revenue service due to electrical and mechanical differences [2] . The IMU120s are fitted with electric plug doors as opposed to air operated plug doors on the IMU100s, they are fitted with one A/C pod per car as opposed to two, and the cooling system has been changed to water cooling which eliminates the noise associated with the traction blower fans [14] . In order to keep the auxiliary converters and systems online through neutral sections of track, IMU120s and SMU220s automatically apply a small amount of regenerative braking while traversing sections at speeds above 20km/h. This reduces the need to rely on the battery system and is also the reason why they maintain full lighting and air conditioning compared to other units in the fleet. However, this can produce a nasty shudder through the train at speeds around 40-60km/h which is mostly unpreventable and varys depending on the unit [15] .

The units are virtually identical to the TransPerth B series trains [19] , which incorporate a European style Streamlined design, albeit with exposed Air-conditioning Pods [18] . They are also similar to the V/Line VLocity DMU, and Adelaide Metro 4000 class EMU trains with alterations to the headlights to complement with the rest of the Citytrain fleet [2] . They operate as three-car sets, with a driving motor car at each end and a trailer car in the middle. The trailer cars have pantographs but do not have motors [19] These trains are interoperable with the 260 series Suburban Multiple Units as they have almost identical specifications [2] . In 2007, it was discovered during a \"1200-point check\" that the air conditioning units on top of the carriages had been built 10mm too wide for the loading gauge, sparking concerns over tunnel clearance in a 4m section between Central and Fortitude Valley stations [20] .

While the 160/260 is going through overhaul, the fire standard for overhaul allows you to replace components with materials \"no worse than\" the original from a fire performance perspective.

Check out SMU on Wikipedia . The SMUs are a class of units used by QR in SEQ, manufactured between 1994 and 2011. SMUs are divided into 3 subclasses, the SMU200, SMU220, and SMU260 [1] . There are only minor differences between the classes of SMUs, and they have a very similar cab design and operating procedures to other trains on the network [14] . Like all other passenger trains operating within the Brisbane Suburban Area, SMUs are fitted with AWS (Audible Warning System). When there is an upcoming restrictive signal (any signal other than green), the driver must acknowledge the warning provided for it within three seconds of its receipt by pressing a button on trains' control panels. If the approaching signal is green, no acknowledgment by the driver is required. Should a train proceed past a restrictive signal without the driver having first acknowledged the warning, the train\u2019s emergency brakes are automatically applied to stop the train. For AWS to operate, both track and rollingstock must be equipped [15] . SMUs, along with IMUs, EMUs, and probably NGRs, are also fitted with door sensors and traction interlocks. The sensors trigger the doors to open if they detect an obstruction upon closing, much like an elevator door. Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed [15] . SMUs, IMUs and ICEs were supplied with rigid steel skirts that protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment. These skirts extend to within approximately 50 mm of the rails, and provide a measure of protection from damage caused by collisions with obstructions at track level [15] . Walkers/Adtranz Suburban Multiple Unit 200 series (SMU200) \u00b6 The SMU200 as seen on QR's Carriage Layouts page The 12 SMU200s were introduced in 1994 due to a shortage in rollingstock caused by an increase in demand [1] , as well as to offset the loco-hauled SX Set run services that were slowly being phased out for health and safety reasons [2] . The trains, numbered SMU201-212, entered service on the 16 th of August 1994 and were the first new trains since EMU deliveries ended in 1989 [1] . The units used modern GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor traction control systems [8] (EMUs also used thyristor TCS's), with the units set up similar to the EMUs with a Driver-Motor, Motor, and Driver Trailer cars. They use blower for cooling both the traction equipment and braking grids, and although the EMUs are quite louder with their high-pitch traction motors, the SMU200s (and IMU100s) are known to be quite loud on take-off due to their blowers winding up. Although when running they are very quiet and have the typical gear switching sound of a thyristor control system [2] . Train drivers also have access to full computerized information about the performance of the train [8] . The SMU200s are commonly mixed with SMU220 class to make up 6-car trains, however as they use the Scharfenburg coupler they can be coupled to EMUs, IMUs, ICE sets, and Tilt Trains for haulage purposes only as they are not 100% electrically compatible [2] . It appears that they used to be paired with IMU100/120s, but they stopped doing it in about 2014 [13] . Allegedly, \"the brakes are quite different so they always felt rough as guts when they stopped\" [12] . They were also paired with EMUs early on, but after a derailment between Central and Roma Street (leaving the old tunnels towards Platform 7) they put a stop to it [12] . The SMU200s were fitted with the Digital Voice Announcement System, which inform the passengers of the route and next station over the Public Address system, from their manufacturing, while the EMUs were only fitted with it later [4] . They also featured new Passenger Emergency Intercoms, which were also added to the EMUs later [8] . Specs \u00b6 Spec Value Manufacturer Walkers Ltd.

This work was done by Downer EDI Rail for $105,430,828 [10] . December 2018 : Downer awarded an $80 million contract to overhaul the IMU100s and SMU200s to be completed at Downer\u2019s Maryborough Service Delivery Centre [5] , including: Interior refresh \u2013 new floor coverings, refreshed handrails and grab handles and new seat foams and covers for enhanced customer experience Overhaul of key train subsystems to ensure the safety and reliability of the fleet New electrical systems (in partnership with ABB), including upgrade of onboard traction equipment and installation of a new Train Control Management System (TCMS). January 17, 2020 : QR paid out $2.6 million to CoachAir for \"2019 IMU100 SMU200 HVAC Overhaul\" , possibly as part of Downer's refurbishment that started Dec 2018 [11] . 2023 : QR replaced the routers in EMUs, IMU100s, SMU200s, IMU120s, and SMU220s. The work was contracted out to Nomad Digital and cost $1.75 million [11] . 2023 : Downer's SMU200 overhaul completed [5] . December 5, 2023 : Noske-Kaeser New Zealand awarded a contract to complete 10 Year Overhauls on IMU100s and SMU200s, including these replacements [7] : Compressors and various refrigeration components The PLC and switching gear Safety devices such as pressure transducers and heaters overtemperature switches Heaters, fans, insulation on covers [add new?] Circuit breakers to address obsolescence of existing breakers and compliance with MD-10-125 2036 : SMU200s anticipated to commence retirement (as of August 2021) [9] .

You can read it here . In June 1996, QR made an investment submission to Queensland Transport (QT), recommending the government to purchase 30 x 3 car sets of rollingstock to operate a safe, efficient, and reliable rail service until 2002/2003. The purpose of purchasing the additional rollingstock was fourfold [16] : Firstly, it would help QR play its part in achieving the state government\u2019s objective of increasing public transport usage by 50% by 2011. This was a bold objective as public transport usage was decreasing. Secondly, QR would use twelve of the three car sets to cater for the continuing increase in rail patronage, particularly during peak hours. Rail patronage grew from 37 million passengers in 1994-95 to 41.5 million passengers in 1997-98. QR anticipated that patronage for Citytrain services would increase to 47.5 million passengers by 2002-2003. The twelve three car sets would be configured as six, six car trains. Two of these trains would operate on the Caboolture line, two on the Beenleigh line and two on the Ipswich line. With the introduction of the tilt trains in November 1998, three of the five car ICE (Inter-City Express) trains would be available for the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane line. Thirdly, QR would use fourteen of the new three car sets to replace the inferior silver SX rollingstock which it still used on peak hour Citytrain services. SX carriages were not electrified, were slower than the new rollingstock, have doors and windows which were difficult to open, inferior seating, and were drawn by diesel locomotives which produce more noise and air pollution than the new locomotives. They were also not well patronised as rail passengers usually prefer to wait for an electrified train. Finally, four of the new three car sets would allow QR to reduce utilisation levels of its rollingstock. At the time, QR used about 98% of its rollingstock during peak periods. This made it difficult for QR to carry out preventative maintenance on its fleet which adversely impacted on the reliability and longevity of the rollingstock. Benchmarking studies showed that optimal utilisation of rollingstock is 87% to 91%. With the new rollingstock QR aimed to reduce its utilisation level to 94%. QR advised that it can provide sustainable and reliable services at a level of 94% [16] . There were some concerns on whether thirty sets is sufficient to meet the Integrated Regional Transport Plan (IRTP) objective of increasing public transport usage by 50% by 2011. QR stated that the additional rollingstock would enable it to meet anticipated patronage up to 2003 but is inadequate to meet the increased service frequencies recommended in the IRTP. The IRTP stated that the \"long-term minimum services level targets\" were [16] : a train travelling through the inner city every 7.5 minutes during peak periods and every 15 minutes during off-peak a train travelling to outer suburban and coastal areas every 15 minutes during peak periods and every 30 minutes during off-peak. This level of service should start to occur from 2001. At the time, QR provided [16] : a train travelling through the inner city every 5-10 minutes during peak periods and every 15 minutes during off-peak a train travelling to outer suburban and coastal areas, on average, every 24 minutes during peak periods and, on average, every 46 minutes during off peak In September 1996, QR commenced negotiations with Walkers to construct 12 x 3 car SMU220 sets on the understanding that they would only have funding for 12, not 30, sets. They approached Walkers because of their proven track record, 20 year history of constructing rollingstock for QR and design expertise as exemplified in the design and construction of the tilt trains. Walkers also won the contract to construct twelve SMUs and ten IMUs in 1991 bidding only against Goninans [16] . QR decided not to go to tender reasoning that a twelve SMU package would be too small for a new supplier to effectively compete against an established supplier (Walkers). Furthermore, QR had a benchmark cost for the construction of SMU200s from 1991 and required Walkers to reduce that cost. As a Government Owned Corporation, QR is not subject to the provisions of the State Purchasing Policy [16] . QR also chose Adtranz Australia to work with Walkers over GEC-Alsthom. This was done for three reasons: Walkers and Adtranz have worked together before (eg. on the tilt trains); Adtranz provided a better price and contractual issues such as product warranty and reliability guarantees [16] . With the acquistion of new rollingstock, QR aimed to [16] : take advantage of the recent significant advances in traction technology refine the current design for SMUs by building a much higher level of performance and reliability into their trains achieve a reduction in the capital cost per unit. To keep the auxiliary converters (and systems) online through neutral sections 220\u2019s and 120\u2019s automatically apply a small amount of regenerative braking when traversing neutral sections at speeds above 20km/h. This reduces the need to rely on the battery system and is why they maintain full lighting and air conditioning compared to other units in the fleet. For some reason at speeds around 40-60km/h they can produce a rather nasty shudder through the train. As a driver there isn\u2019t much that can be done to prevent it. Some do it, some don\u2019t, some are worse than others. Just a quirk of the units.

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/k0hqc3/comment/gdijsfo SMU232 was installed with new white destination boards that are going to be used on the QTMPs [24] . It was seen testing them by jrvh31 ( flickr ) on the 25th of May, and I also spotted it on June the 2nd: SMU232/225 running a test train approaching Sunshine. This unit is testing new destination boards that will be seen on QR\u2019s new QTMP Multiple Units. All rights reserved by jrvh31 These units had several benefits compared to the EMUs [16] : Air conditioning units are positioned in the roof in the centre of each carriage rather than on the sides. This decreases condensation on the windows and failure due to humidity. The rollingstock features an improved traction package which includes a driver monitoring system. A computer near the driver gives a graphic display of the train functions and notifies the driver when there is a fault, the location of the fault and the rectification procedure, where possible. All carriages have CCTV security cameras installed. A QR guard can monitor activities in the carriages as the cameras are linked to a display system which scrolls through screens showing each carriage. The seats have new arms which are more difficult for vandals to break off. Other anti-vandalism measures already incorporated into most rollingstock are carpet up the side walls to the windows, the security cameras and retention of a guard on each train. The new rollingstock has more rotatable parts which increases the speed of maintenance and repairs. SMU220s do not have toilets or luggage compartments. At the time of ordering, QR maintained that toilets are not necessary on suburban trains as the average trip length is 19 kilometres and toilets are provided at most stations [16] .

QR argued that a contract of this size would attract tenders from Walkers in Maryborough and Goninans in Newcastle, thereby providing the government with a very competitive price [16] . September 1996 : QR commenced negotiations with Walkers to construct 12 x 3 car sets on the understanding that they would only have funding for 12 and not 30, 3 car sets [16] . 1997 : Following the adoption of the IRTP objectives and the finalisation of the state budget, QR received funding firstly for 18 x 3 car sets and then for an additional 12 x 3 car sets. It awarded contracts to Walkers as follows: 18 x 3 car sets awarded 30 April 1997. Base contract price: $134,812,830. Price per 3 car set: $7,489,601 12 x 3 car sets awarded 4 June 1997. Base contract price: $81,521,190. Price per 3 car set: $6,793,432 The price per car set differs between the two contracts because the first contract contains payment for design work and extra spare parts. The then Coalition state government endorsed both contracts prior to them being issued to Walkers [16] . 2038 : SMU220s anticipated to commence retirement (as of August 2021) [9] .

Between 2004 and 2006, public transport trips increased 9.7% and 11.6% respectively year-over-year. This growth was propelled by several factors, including the introduction of integrated fares and ticketing in 2004 and progressive improvements to service levels [17] . Projections from the time also indicated a significant 57% rise in employment within the Brisbane CBD from 2006 to 2026 [18] . The need was recognized by QR, and in 2005 they ordered eight SMU260s from Downer EDI Rail to cater for this increase in demand [21] . The SMU260 series was specifically introduced as a \"congestion-busting fleet,\" designed to provide a substantial increase in the number of available seats for commuters [19] . The first two units, SMU261-262, official entered service in August of 2008, and were observed operating Ekka shuttle services on August 11, 2008 [21] . In March 2009, a further 20 trains were ordered, scheduled for delivery between August 2010 and December 2011 [20] . Note: Somehow, there is a large discrepancy in the timeline as, even though I've only found evidence for the order of 8 trains in 2005 and 20 more in 2009 (or perhaps 14, according to wuiskemodels [21] ), in total 36 trains were delivered. Perhaps there was another order in the middle or something. The SMU260 operates as a permanently-coupled 3-car set, with two sets often coupled together to form a 6-car train for increased capacity and redundancy [23] (operating as a 6-car set is is the preferred business operating model [22] ).

Check out SMU on Wikipedia . The SMUs are a class of units used by QR in SEQ, manufactured between 1994 and 2011. SMUs are divided into 3 subclasses, the SMU200, SMU220, and SMU260 [1] . There are only minor differences between the classes of SMUs, and they have a very similar cab design and operating procedures to other trains on the network [14] . Like all other passenger trains operating within the Brisbane Suburban Area, SMUs are fitted with AWS (Audible Warning System). When there is an upcoming restrictive signal (any signal other than green), the driver must acknowledge the warning provided for it within three seconds of its receipt by pressing a button on trains' control panels. If the approaching signal is green, no acknowledgment by the driver is required. Should a train proceed past a restrictive signal without the driver having first acknowledged the warning, the train\u2019s emergency brakes are automatically applied to stop the train. For AWS to operate, both track and rollingstock must be equipped [15] . SMUs, along with IMUs, EMUs, and probably NGRs, are also fitted with door sensors and traction interlocks. The sensors trigger the doors to open if they detect an obstruction upon closing, much like an elevator door. Traction interlocks block power to the trains\u2019 drive motors until all doors have fully closed preventing trains from moving with doors open or obstructed [15] . SMUs, IMUs and ICEs were supplied with rigid steel skirts that protect the wheels and undercarriage equipment. These skirts extend to within approximately 50 mm of the rails, and provide a measure of protection from damage caused by collisions with obstructions at track level [15] .","title":"SMU (Suburban Multiple Unit)"},{"location":"Rollingstock/SMU/#walkersadtranz-suburban-multiple-unit-200-series-smu200","text":"The SMU200 as seen on QR's Carriage Layouts page The 12 SMU200s were introduced in 1994 due to a shortage in rollingstock caused by an increase in demand [1] , as well as to offset the loco-hauled SX Set run services that were slowly being phased out for health and safety reasons [2] . The trains, numbered SMU201-212, entered service on the 16 th of August 1994 and were the first new trains since EMU deliveries ended in 1989 [1] . The units used modern GTO (gate turn-off) thyristor traction control systems [8] (EMUs also used thyristor TCS's), with the units set up similar to the EMUs with a Driver-Motor, Motor, and Driver Trailer cars. They use blower for cooling both the traction equipment and braking grids, and although the EMUs are quite louder with their high-pitch traction motors, the SMU200s (and IMU100s) are known to be quite loud on take-off due to their blowers winding up. Although when running they are very quiet and have the typical gear switching sound of a thyristor control system [2] . Train drivers also have access to full computerized information about the performance of the train [8] . The SMU200s are commonly mixed with SMU220 class to make up 6-car trains, however as they use the Scharfenburg coupler they can be coupled to EMUs, IMUs, ICE sets, and Tilt Trains for haulage purposes only as they are not 100% electrically compatible [2] . It appears that they used to be paired with IMU100/120s, but they stopped doing it in about 2014 [13] . Allegedly, \"the brakes are quite different so they always felt rough as guts when they stopped\" [12] . They were also paired with EMUs early on, but after a derailment between Central and Roma Street (leaving the old tunnels towards Platform 7) they put a stop to it [12] . The SMU200s were fitted with the Digital Voice Announcement System, which inform the passengers of the route and next station over the Public Address system, from their manufacturing, while the EMUs were only fitted with it later [4] . They also featured new Passenger Emergency Intercoms, which were also added to the EMUs later [8] .","title":"Walkers/Adtranz Suburban Multiple Unit 200 series (SMU200)"},{"location":"Rollingstock/SMU/#specs","text":"Spec Value Manufacturer Walkers Ltd.

You can read it here . In June 1996, QR made an investment submission to Queensland Transport (QT), recommending the government to purchase 30 x 3 car sets of rollingstock to operate a safe, efficient, and reliable rail service until 2002/2003. The purpose of purchasing the additional rollingstock was fourfold [16] : Firstly, it would help QR play its part in achieving the state government\u2019s objective of increasing public transport usage by 50% by 2011. This was a bold objective as public transport usage was decreasing. Secondly, QR would use twelve of the three car sets to cater for the continuing increase in rail patronage, particularly during peak hours. Rail patronage grew from 37 million passengers in 1994-95 to 41.5 million passengers in 1997-98. QR anticipated that patronage for Citytrain services would increase to 47.5 million passengers by 2002-2003. The twelve three car sets would be configured as six, six car trains. Two of these trains would operate on the Caboolture line, two on the Beenleigh line and two on the Ipswich line. With the introduction of the tilt trains in November 1998, three of the five car ICE (Inter-City Express) trains would be available for the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane line. Thirdly, QR would use fourteen of the new three car sets to replace the inferior silver SX rollingstock which it still used on peak hour Citytrain services. SX carriages were not electrified, were slower than the new rollingstock, have doors and windows which were difficult to open, inferior seating, and were drawn by diesel locomotives which produce more noise and air pollution than the new locomotives. They were also not well patronised as rail passengers usually prefer to wait for an electrified train. Finally, four of the new three car sets would allow QR to reduce utilisation levels of its rollingstock. At the time, QR used about 98% of its rollingstock during peak periods. This made it difficult for QR to carry out preventative maintenance on its fleet which adversely impacted on the reliability and longevity of the rollingstock. Benchmarking studies showed that optimal utilisation of rollingstock is 87% to 91%. With the new rollingstock QR aimed to reduce its utilisation level to 94%. QR advised that it can provide sustainable and reliable services at a level of 94% [16] . There were some concerns on whether thirty sets is sufficient to meet the Integrated Regional Transport Plan (IRTP) objective of increasing public transport usage by 50% by 2011. QR stated that the additional rollingstock would enable it to meet anticipated patronage up to 2003 but is inadequate to meet the increased service frequencies recommended in the IRTP. The IRTP stated that the \"long-term minimum services level targets\" were [16] : a train travelling through the inner city every 7.5 minutes during peak periods and every 15 minutes during off-peak a train travelling to outer suburban and coastal areas every 15 minutes during peak periods and every 30 minutes during off-peak. This level of service should start to occur from 2001. At the time, QR provided [16] : a train travelling through the inner city every 5-10 minutes during peak periods and every 15 minutes during off-peak a train travelling to outer suburban and coastal areas, on average, every 24 minutes during peak periods and, on average, every 46 minutes during off peak In September 1996, QR commenced negotiations with Walkers to construct 12 x 3 car SMU220 sets on the understanding that they would only have funding for 12, not 30, sets. They approached Walkers because of their proven track record, 20 year history of constructing rollingstock for QR and design expertise as exemplified in the design and construction of the tilt trains. Walkers also won the contract to construct twelve SMUs and ten IMUs in 1991 bidding only against Goninans [16] . QR decided not to go to tender reasoning that a twelve SMU package would be too small for a new supplier to effectively compete against an established supplier (Walkers). Furthermore, QR had a benchmark cost for the construction of SMU200s from 1991 and required Walkers to reduce that cost. As a Government Owned Corporation, QR is not subject to the provisions of the State Purchasing Policy [16] . QR also chose Adtranz Australia to work with Walkers over GEC-Alsthom. This was done for three reasons: Walkers and Adtranz have worked together before (eg. on the tilt trains); Adtranz provided a better price and contractual issues such as product warranty and reliability guarantees [16] . With the acquistion of new rollingstock, QR aimed to [16] : take advantage of the recent significant advances in traction technology refine the current design for SMUs by building a much higher level of performance and reliability into their trains achieve a reduction in the capital cost per unit. To keep the auxiliary converters (and systems) online through neutral sections 220\u2019s and 120\u2019s automatically apply a small amount of regenerative braking when traversing neutral sections at speeds above 20km/h. This reduces the need to rely on the battery system and is why they maintain full lighting and air conditioning compared to other units in the fleet. For some reason at speeds around 40-60km/h they can produce a rather nasty shudder through the train. As a driver there isn\u2019t much that can be done to prevent it. Some do it, some don\u2019t, some are worse than others. Just a quirk of the units.

This unit is testing new destination boards that will be seen on QR\u2019s new QTMP Multiple Units. All rights reserved by jrvh31 These units had several benefits compared to the EMUs [16] : Air conditioning units are positioned in the roof in the centre of each carriage rather than on the sides. This decreases condensation on the windows and failure due to humidity. The rollingstock features an improved traction package which includes a driver monitoring system. A computer near the driver gives a graphic display of the train functions and notifies the driver when there is a fault, the location of the fault and the rectification procedure, where possible. All carriages have CCTV security cameras installed. A QR guard can monitor activities in the carriages as the cameras are linked to a display system which scrolls through screens showing each carriage. The seats have new arms which are more difficult for vandals to break off. Other anti-vandalism measures already incorporated into most rollingstock are carpet up the side walls to the windows, the security cameras and retention of a guard on each train. The new rollingstock has more rotatable parts which increases the speed of maintenance and repairs. SMU220s do not have toilets or luggage compartments.

It can also provide information on the bus and train, like run number, vehicle model, and other stats. However, it is not perfect as it uses the run number to determine the vehicle model, only allowing it to accurately tell you if the train is an NGR, or could be an EMU. Most of the run numbers for the suburban network start with either 1 , D , T , or J . As you can see at the Train Numbering Guide , 1 and J can be either an SMU or EMU, and SMU260s with IMU160s regularly use run numbers that start with T or 1 . The run number can be used to divine more information, however. If the 2nd digit is a 6 , then it is an EMU running Rosewood service. The app does have a paid tier, promising ad-free operation and extra features including showing passing stops at a train, showing passing trains at a stop, and displaying the run number on the map, these do not actually work in QLD. It also promises more frequent updates and beta features, but last I can tell the app was updated in 2023.

You may get like 3 IMUs a day, so not exactly common and most probably no EMUs. Beenleigh / Ferny Grove \u00b6 The NGR trains are not able to run on the Ferny Grove line at all, as they leave a large gap between the train and platform at some stations, meaning passengers cannot board safely and, at Newmarket and Keperra, the platforms are too short to accommodate the NGR trains at all. Due to these issues\u2014and the pairing of the Ferny Grove and Beenleigh lines\u2014it means the NGR trains also do not run on the Beenleigh line as part of the regular timetable [1] . Thus, mostly IMUs / SMUs will appear on the line, with EMUs sometimes on Ferny Grove. Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line: \u00b6 NGRs are common on the Redcliffe Peninsula / Springfield Line because of the large amount of stabling at Kippa Ring, as well as at Wulkuraka/Redbank. However, there are rarely EMUs on it when it's not an NGR. Rosewood \u00b6 On the Rosewood line, the NGR trains are too long for the platform, forcing passengers into the front three cars, otherwise they would step and fall onto the tracks [1] . Therefore, there is mostly IMUs, SMUs, and EMUs on the Rosewood line. Ipswich / Caboolture / Nambour \u00b6 Mainly SMUs and IMUs but some NGRs. Gympie North \u00b6 NGRs are now allowed on the Gympie North line. NGRs will not operate on Sunshine Coast line services north of Nambour until signalling upgrades to Gympie North have been completed. Currently trains are required to be compatible with the operation of Automatic Train Protection which isn't fitted on the NGRs. (Information may be outdated). The Gympie North line generally features IMU100's/120's due to the ATP requirement. https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/17v0tsi/comment/k98p2kb/ Correct, need a forward facing observer seat in the driving cab for a second driver which the 160/260s don\u2019t have and ngrs cant work past nambour yet. There's this thing called route competency, and only Gympie North, some Nambour, some Caboolture and some Mayne (Bowen Hills) depot crew are qualified for. There are some crew at Mayne who can't work north of Northgate, or south of Yeerongpilly/Corinda. And there's a bit of a clique with old timers who want to keep their \"rare\" route competency for themselves, and there's a big thing with seniority of service to learn extra routes such as Nambour and Gympie North. Cleveland / Shorncliffe \u00b6 The Cleveland / Shorncliffe line has the second least amount of NGRs on it, after Beenleigh / Ferny Grove, most likely due to stabling reasons. However, it is still mostly NGRs. Post CRR \u00b6 NGR, along with upgraded SMU 260 trains, will be the only trains permitted to travel in the Cross River Rail tunnels.
